This repository contains the code, content, and all other assets used in
jnielson.com. As it is MIT licensed, you could utilize it, but I would
appreciate you keeping the copyright notice that I added in addition to the
Gatsby one. Either that or attribute me somehow. If you do use this, feel free
to let me know things that could be improved/changed!

This is a test branch to show how I'd branch off a feature branch to handle
conflicting changes.

Originally bootstrapped using the egghead.io creator MDX Blog Starter Project.
At time of creation it had the following README file:

This is based on Robin Wieruch's
https://github.com/rwieruch/gatsby-mdx-blog-starter-project

Lot's of nice pieces are also borrowed from Jason Lengstorf

A starter project in [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) with
[MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx).
