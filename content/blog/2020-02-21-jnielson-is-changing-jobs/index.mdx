Hi there! This post is a bit more of a meta post then what I hope to do in the
future, but there have been some changes in my life situation that I wanted to
share and write about!

🎉 I recently moved to working at a new company, Underbelly Creative Inc. 🎉

Change is hard, but I'm stoked for the opportunities available working here.
[Underbelly](https://underbelly.is) is a digital design, development, and
content agency with an awesome team working on some great projects. I'm still
going to be doing web development, usually utilizing React, next.js, and
styled-components but I'll also be throwing some Typescript, backend stuff with
node, and who knows what else in the mix!

As I talked about in my initial [Who am I Post](https://jnielson.com/who-am-i),
my blog posts aren't going to all be tech focused, and that will probably be
more true with this job since I'll have more experiences related to project
planning, workload timing, working with some fantastic designers directly,
basically a whole slew of new work experiences. I'm also going to be presenting
less, which means that it will probably be a long while before I do another "I
have a presentation coming up" post, not sure if that's good or not though 😂
