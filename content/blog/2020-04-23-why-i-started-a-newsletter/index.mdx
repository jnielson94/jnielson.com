Hi there! I started a newsletter! You can sign up at the bottom of this post, or
by heading over to [the newsletter page](https://jnielson.com/newsletter)!

## Why a newsletter?

First things first, I like newsletters. I prefer to get an email about important
things over any other communication method, in most cases. If someone that I
think does great work has a newsletter, I sign up for it. If you have a
newsletter,
[add it to this twitter thread!](https://twitter.com/jnielson94/status/1253170994757292033)

Secondly, I think I have something useful that you might want to read about.
That's why I started blogging in the first place! Blogging is great, but
sometimes it's hard for people to find what I write. I have
[an RSS feed](https://jnielson.com/rss.xml) for my blog, but not many people I
know still use RSS readers
([even though I do](https://jnielson.com/sharpen-your-axe)). I generally post
about what I write [on my twitter](https://twitter.com/jnielson94), but twitter
is chaotic and hard to find things on. From what I've seen in the newsletters
I'm signed up for, newsletters are a great way to get what I write to people
that want to read it.

## Dealing with inbox clutter?

A common thing I think of when I see a newsletter signup form is "Do I want
another piece of email coming my way?"... usually yes! I chatted with
[Ryan Warner](https://twitter.com/ryanwarnercodes) and a few other people in the
party corgi discord ([which you should join!](https://www.partycorgi.com/))
about adding newsletters to personal websites, and learned that not everyone has
the same approach I do to their email inboxes. For over two years now, I've
subscribed to the "inbox zero" lifestyle. I think there hasn't been an entire
week pass where I've left something in my inbox that couldn't be read and taken
care of, or snoozed for later when it was actionable. For the most part,
newsletters fall into the category of "at least skim, but regardless I'll
archive it when I get to the bottom", which has helped me stay up with inbox
zero while signing up for newsletters wherever I can find them. One of the
nicest things about newsletters is their capability to link out to other things,
which if I have time and interest I can click on... but there's nothing that
says I have to click!

## Why not post more on your blog?

I'm working on it! Taking a page out of
[Chris Biscardi's book](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/content-production/),
I'm going to use my blog as a place to post all sorts of content. If I have a
time-bound newsletter post, it'll probably also end up on my blog. A
[shadow newsletter...](https://joelhooks.com/shadow-newsletter-for-evergreen-emails-in-convertkit)
likely wouldn't end up on my blog...? I dunno yet. I personally like newsletters
that have a link out to a personal site to read them on to break up looking at
my email reader, so maybe it'll end up as a section of my site. 🤷‍♂️

Either way, the blog and newsletter are both priorities for me. The reason for
that, is I enjoy writing! I find writing to be an excellent way to marshal the
thoughts that I have and get them out into the world in a communicable way.
Publishing it, on my blog or newsletter, helps me to get out of my comfort zone
which I think is important enough to put time into.

If you've gotten this far,
[tweet me about it!](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjnielson.com%2Fwhy-i-have-a-newsletter&via=jnielson94&text=I%20made%20it%20to%20the%20end%20of%20why%20@jnielson94%20has%20a%20newsletter%21)
I'm excited to see where this newsletter journey goes from here. 🥳
