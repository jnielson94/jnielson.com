Hi there! I'm Jordan Nielson, and I'm the creator on this here blog site. I'm
hoping to have this site contain all forms of creations that I embark on in my
free time, which to start off with will be these blog posts. I'm hoping that by
spending more time writing about the things I'm learning and doing (in all
aspects of my life), it will help solidify my knowledge and ideally end up
useful to someone else as well.

To start off, you should be aware that I'll be blogging about more than just the
"tech" things in my life. I really enjoy my job, but it is not what I do all
day, every day, so be aware that there will be more personal posts as well.
**Note that every post is my opinion, and does not reflect on my employer,
religion, or anyone else!** Ideally I won't offend anyone, but if something I
post is offensive to you please let me know and I can work with you to adjust
the content (since it is publically available on github), or straight up take it
down.

Alright, so at this point you might be wondering who I am (since that is the
title of this post after all). I'm Jordan, as I mentioned earlier. I currently
work for
[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (The Church)](https://churchofjesuschrist.org)
as a Software Developer focusing on helping and working with the Web Developers
at The Church. I've been working here for about a year at this point, and have
loved almost every minute of it. I graduated from
[Brigham Young University (BYU)](https://byu.edu) with a Computer Science
degree, and while I was in school I spent a good deal of my time working on
websites. I am first and foremost a family man who tries to live The Gospel of
Jesus Christ. My wife and I have two sons currently, which keeps me pretty busy.

As a heads up, I do have an [rss feed](https://jnielson.com/rss.xml) thanks to a
wonderful gatsby plugin and the setup provided by the
gatsby-eeggheadio-blog-starter. I am hoping to blog on here at least once a
week, but it might shake out to be more and might be less. If you have anything
you want me to write about, feel free to file a
[github issue for it](https://github.com/jnielson94/gatsby-starter-egghead-blog/issues/new)!
